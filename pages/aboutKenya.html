  <strong>Weather Overview</strong><br />
      With pleasant overall conditions all year round, Kenya's                        southern highlands and coastal lowlands see little variation                        in conditions; each has a wet season between March and May                        and a second one in November and December. Temperatures                        are consistent throughout the year and cool for an equatorial                        region, ranging from high 20°Cs to low 30°Cs (80°Fs                        to low 90°Fs) on the coast, dropping slightly inland                        and then raising again closer to Lake Victoria.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Geography</strong><br />
      On Africa's east coast, Kenya straddles the equator and                        shares a border with Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and                        Tanzania. Its coast is lapped by the Indian Ocean and it                        shares the vast waters of Lake Victoria with its western                        and southern neighbors. The Rift Valley and Central Highlands                        area form the backbone of the country, and this is where                        Kenya's scenery is at its most spectacular. The humid coastal                        belt includes the Tana River estuary and a string of good                        beaches. Western Kenya takes in the fertile fringes of Lake                        Victoria and, with the southern part of the country, some                        prime wildlife parks. The vast, arid region is where Kenya                        is at its wildest and most untouched by the modern world.<br />

  <strong>Overview</strong><br />
      There are more than 70 tribal groups among the Africans                        in Kenya. Distinctions between many of them are blurred                        - western cultural values are becoming more ingrained and                        traditional values are disintegrating. Yet, even though                        the average Kenyan may have outwardly drifted away from                        tribal traditions, the first question asked when two of                        them meet is 'What tribe are you from?'.<br />
  <br />
      English and Swahili are the languages taught throughout                        the country, but there are many other tribal languages.                        These include Kikuyu, Luhia, Luo and Kikamba as well as                        a plethora of minor tribal tongues. Another language you'll                        come across is Sheng, spoken almost exclusively by the younger                        members of society. A fairly recent development, Sheng is                        a mixture of Swahili and English along with a fair sprinkling                        of other languages.<br />
  <br />
      Most Kenyans outside the coastal and eastern provinces are                        Christians of one sort or another, while most of those on                        the coast and in the eastern part of the country are Muslim.                        Muslims make up some 30% of the population. In the more                        remote tribal areas you'll find a mixture of Muslims, Christians                        and those who follow their ancestral tribal beliefs.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Pre 20th Century History</strong><br />
      The first of many human footprints to be stamped on Kenyan                        soil were left way back in 2000 BC by nomadic Cushitic tribes                        from Ethiopia. A second group followed around 1000 BC and                        occupied much of central Kenya. The rest of the ancestors                        of the country's medley of tribes arrived from all over                        the continent between 500 BC and AD 500. The Bantu-speaking                        people (such as the Gusii, Kikuyu, Akamba and Meru) arrived                        from West Africa while the Nilotic speakers (Maasai, Luo,                        Samburu and Turkana) came from the Nile Valley in southern                        Sudan. As tribes migrated throughout the interior, Muslims                        from the Arabian Peninsula and Shirazis from Persia (now                        Iran) settled along the East African coast from the 8th                        century AD onwards.<br />
  <br />
      Drawn by the whiff of spices and money, the Portuguese started                        exploring around in the 15th century. After venturing further                        and further down the western coast of Africa, Vasco da Gama                        finally rounded the Cape of Good Hope and headed up the                        continent's eastern coast in 1498. Seven years later, the                        Portuguese onslaught on the region began. By the 16th century,                        most of the indigenous Swahili trading towns, including                        Mombasa, had been either sacked or occupied by the Portuguese                        - marking the end of the Arab monopoly of the Indian Ocean                        trade. The Portuguese settled in for a long period of harsh                        colonial rule, playing one sultan off against another. But                        their grip on the coast was always tenuous because their                        outposts had to be supplied from Goa in India. Control of                        the coast was won back by the Arabs in 1720.<br />
  <br />
      The remainder of the 18th century saw the Omani dynasties                        from the Persian Gulf dug in along the East African coast.                        The depredations of the Portuguese era and constant quarrels                        among the Arab governors caused a decline in trade and prosperity,                        which meant that economic powerhouses such as Britain and                        Germany weren't interested in grabbing a slice of East Africa                        until about the mid-19th century.<br />
  <br />
      With Europeans suddenly tramping all over Africa in search                        of fame and fortune, even Kenya's intimidating interior                        was forced to give up its secrets to outsiders. Until the                        1880s, the Rift Valley and the Aberdare highlands remained                        the heartland of the proud warrior tribe, the Maasai. By                        the late 19th century, years of civil war between the Maasai's                        two opposing factions had weakened the tribe. Disease and                        famine had also taken their toll. This opened the way for                        the English to negotiate a treaty with the Maasai laibon                        (chief, or spiritual leader) and begin work on the Mombasa-Uganda                        railway - which cut straight through the Maasai grazing                        lands. The halfway point of this railway is roughly where                        Nairobi stands today.<br />
  <br />
      It was downhill from here for the Maasai. As white settlers                        demanded more fertile land, the Maasai were herded into                        smaller reserves. The Kikuyu, a Bantu agricultural tribe                        from the highlands west of Mt Kenya, also had vast tracts                        of land ripped from under their feet.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Modern History</strong><br />
      White settlement in the early 20th century was initially                        disastrous, but - once they bothered to learn a little about                        the land - the British succeeded in making their colony                        viable. Other European settlers soon established coffee                        plantations and by the 1950s the white-settler population                        had reached about 80,000. With little choice left but to                        hop on the economic hamster wheel created by the Europeans,                        tribes such as the Kikuyu nonetheless maintained their rage.                        Harry Thuku, an early leader of the Kikuyu political association,                        was duly jailed by the British in 1922. His successor, Johnstone                        Kamau (later Jomo Kenyatta) was to become independent Kenya's                        first president.<br />
  <br />
      As opposition to colonial rule grew, the Kenya African Union                        (KAU) emerged and became strident in its demands. Other                        such societies soon added their voices to the cry for freedom,                        including the Mau Mau, whose members (mainly Kikuyu) vowed                        to drive white settlers out of Kenya. The ensuing Mau Mau                        Rebellion ended in 1956 with the defeat of the rebels. The                        death toll stood at over 13,500 Africans - Mau Mau guerrillas,                        civilians and troops - and just over 100 Europeans.<br />
  <br />
      Kenyatta spent years in jail or under house arrest but was                        freed in 1961 and became leader of the reincarnated KAU,                        the Kenya African National Union (KANU). He ushered in independence                        on 12 December 1963, and under his presidency the country                        developed into one of Africa's most stable and prosperous                        nations. Kenyatta was succeeded after his death in 1978                        by Daniel Arap Moi, a member of the Tugen tribe.<br />
  <br />
      Moi's rule was characterised by nepotism, rifts and dissension.                        He took criticism badly and as a result oversaw the disbanding                        of tribal societies, disrupted universities and harassed                        opposition politicians. A coup attempt by the Kenyan Air                        Force in 1982 was put down by forces loyal to Moi. With                        the winds of democratic pluralism sweeping Africa in the                        late 1980s and early 1990s, international aid for Moi's                        Kenya was suspended.<br />
  <br />
      The International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and                        major aid donors demanded that repression cease and Moi's                        political stranglehold ease. He conceded ground, but much                        to his delight, the opposition in the 1993 election shot                        itself in the foot - The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy                        (FORD) was unable to agree on a leader. By splitting into                        three parties, FORD's much-vaunted cause became hopeless.                        Moi, the beneficiary of his opposition's vanity, won with                        just one-third of the vote.<br />
  <br />
      In 1995, a new party was launched in an attempt to unite                        the splintered opposition. The party was Safina, founded                        by Richard Leakey, famed anthropologist, elephant saviour                        and political activist. Elections were held in Kenya at                        the end of 1997. Despite widespread allegations of vote                        rigging and considerable intimidation of opposition candidates,                        Moi and KANU once again scraped home with a little over                        40% of the vote. Although Moi promised to rid the government                        of corruption, this was met by an air of resignation in                        the country, with Kenyans sitting tight until the day when                        he retired. Then, in August 1998 terrorists bombed the US                        embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, killing over 250                        people and injuring more than 5000, illustrating Kenya's                        vulnerability to increased social and political turmoil.<br />

  <strong>Recent History</strong><br />
      In 2002 Moi decided to retire on very generous retirement                        benefits. At the December 2002 elections, KANU was routed                        by the National Rainbow Coalition, led by Mwai Mbaki. This                        brought about a feeling of new optimism in the country,                        but there have been signs since that the new government                        is as intolerant of dissent as its predecessor.<br />
  <br />
      Meanwhile, Kenya struggled with a number of familiar problems.                        HIV remains as a major problem and, as a reminder that the                        threat of terrorism was ongoing, there was a suicide bomb                        blast at a hotel north of Mombasa in November 2002. In recent                        years, Kenya has experienced major floods, cholera and malaria                        epidemics, ethnic fighting and drought, leading to food                        shortages in mid-2004 that were deemed a national crisis                        by President Kibaki.<br />
  <br />
      In March 2004, the long-awaited draft for a new constitution                        was released, but it had failed to win parliamentary approval                        by a deadline set for the middle of the same year.<br />
  <br />
      Government disharmony continued in 2005 with extraordinary                        corruption allegations against the Kibaki government by                        the British High Commissioner. This resulted in suspension                        of aid by the Dutch, US and German governments with the                        EU and Japan threatening to follow suit if the government                        did not address corruption in the ranks. This lead to more                        infighting and factions within the Kibaki government.<br />
  <br />
      Allegations of media censorship in 2006, along with the                        worst drought in a decade hitting hard, mean the challenges                        facing the Kibaki government remain profound. A planned                        bid for the 2016 Olympic Games could be a catalyst for change                        or a distraction from the hard work of reversing the declining                        standard of living in this yet-lively country. </p>
